# Pokedex React

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It is a simple Pokédex that shows a list of all the pokémon. You can click on a pokémon to show more information.

All of this information is obtained from the [PokeApi](https://pokeapi.co/)
